| Problem Description                    | The problem is well described and it's clear what the problem the project solves                                                                                                                                                                |           |
| Cloud                                  | The project is developed on the cloud and IaC tools are used for provisioning the infrastructure                                                                                                                                                |           |
| Experiment tracking and model registry | Both experiment tracking and model registry are used                                                                                                                                                                                            |           |
| Workflow orchestration                 | Fully deployed workflow                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |           |
| Model deployment                       | The model deployment code is containerized and could be deployed to cloud or special tools for model deployment are used                                                                                                                        |           |
| Model monitoring                       | Comprehensive model monitoring that sends alerts or runs a conditional workflow (e.g. retraining, generating debugging dashboard, switching to a different model) if the defined metrics threshold is violated                                  |           |
| Reproducibility                        | Instructions are clear, it's easy to run the code, and it works. The versions for all the dependencies are specified.                                                                                                                           |           |
| Best practices                         | There are unit tests (1 point)<br/>There is an integration test (1 point)<br/>Linter and/or code formatter are used (1 point)<br/>There's a Makefile (1 point)<br/>There are pre-commit hooks (1 point)<br/>There's a CI/CD pipeline (2 points) |           |
